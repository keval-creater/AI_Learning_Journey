# 🧠 AI_Learning_Journey

This repository tracks my journey of learning Artificial Intelligence from scratch.

- `Learning/` – Daily notebooks while learning concepts.
- `AI_Projects/` – Hands-on AI projects I build.
- `Notes/` – Cheatsheets and quick notes.

A structured 6–8 month roadmap to learn **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** from scratch.  
This repository documents my complete journey — from **Python fundamentals** to building **real AI projects** — with organized daily notebooks, notes, and hands-on projects.
